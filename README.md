# full-stack-project
# Music Portfolio Website

## 👤 Name
**Rock Nasr**

## 🔌 API Used
**Quotes API (category=music)** from [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/api/quotes) — This was the only API that suited the nature of the project.

## 🎵 Project Description
This is a personal project aimed at building a website about me as a musician. The site presents real details about my musical work, vision, and public image. It's built with the intention of being directly deployable if I decide to launch a professional musician's website in the future. With minimal adjustments, this project can become a live portfolio showcasing my music, background, and media.

## 🛠️ Custom Requirement
A custom feature is implemented under the **Music** category, where users can switch between **Singles** and **Covers** using a dynamic toggle. This allows for a more organized and interactive browsing experience, giving visitors a way to explore different types of musical content.
